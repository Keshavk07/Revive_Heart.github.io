   <h2>What should you know about your heart rate?</h2>
   <p>A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute.</p>
  <p>Generally, a lower heart rate at rest implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness. For example, a well-trained athlete might have a normal resting heart rate closer to 40 beats per minute.</p>
  <p>
  To measure your heart rate, simply check your pulse. Place your index and third fingers on your neck to the side of your windpipe. To check your pulse at your wrist, place two fingers between the bone and the tendon over your radial artery — which is located on the thumb side of your wrist.</p>


  <p> When you feel your pulse, count the number of beats in 15 seconds. Multiply this number by four to calculate your beats per minute.</p>
  <p>Keep in mind that many factors can influence heart rate, including:-</p>
<ul class="a">
    <li>1. Age</li>
    <li>2. Fitness and activity status</li>
    <li>3. Being a smoker</li>
    <li>4. Having cardiovascular disease</li>
    <li>5. Diabetes</li>
    <li>6. Body Position</li>
    <li>7. Emotions</li>
    <li>8. Body size</li>
    <li>9. Medications</li>
</ul>

        <h2>When To Call Your Doctor</h2>

   <p> If you’re on a beta blocker to decrease your heart rate (and lower blood pressure) or to control an abnormal rhythm (arrhythmia), your doctor may ask you to monitor and log your heart rate. Keeping tabs on your heart rate can help your doctor determine whether to change the dosage or switch to a different medication.</p>
  
<p>If your pulse is very low or if you have frequent episodes of unexplained fast heart rates, especially if they cause you to feel weak or dizzy or faint, tell your doctor, who can decide if it’s an emergency. Your pulse is one tool to help get a picture of your health.</p>

<h2>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR): First aid</h2>
<p>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a lifesaving technique that's useful in many emergencies, such as a heart attack or near drowning, in which someone's breathing or heartbeat has stopped. The American Heart Association recommends starting CPR with hard and fast chest compressions. This hands-only CPR recommendation applies to both untrained bystanders and first responders.</p>
