       <h3>What Is Mental Health?</h3>
       <p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.</p>

    <h3>Mental Health Myths & Facts</h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>Myth: Children don't experience mental health problems.</h3>
            <p>Fact: Even very young children may show early warning signs of mental health concerns. These mental health problems are often clinically diagnosable, and can be a product of the interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors.</p>
        <h4>Myth: People with mental health problems are violent and unpredictable.</h4>
        <p>Fact: The vast majority of people with mental health problems are no more likely to be violent than anyone else. Most people with mental illness are not violent and only 3%â€“5% of violent acts can be attributed to individuals living with a serious mental illness.</p>
        <h4>Myth: People with mental health needs, even those who are managing their mental illness, cannot tolerate the stress of holding down a job.</h4>
        <p>Fact: People with mental health problems are just as productive as other employees. Employers who hire people with mental health problems report good attendance and punctuality as well as motivation, good work, and job tenure on par with or greater than other employees.</p>
